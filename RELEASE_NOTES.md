# CineFlux-AutoXML v1.0.0 Release Notes (DRAFT)

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This release is currently blocked due to critical TypeScript configuration issues. These notes represent the planned v1.0.0 release once these issues are resolved.

## Current Status

CineFlux-AutoXML v1.0.0 is currently **NOT READY FOR RELEASE** due to critical TypeScript configuration issues that prevent the application from rendering properly. The development team is actively working to resolve these issues.

## Overview

CineFlux-AutoXML is an advanced web application for automated video editing and XML generation. It leverages WebAssembly technology to provide high-performance audio and video analysis directly in the browser, enabling sophisticated editing decisions based on audio beats, video scene detection, and user preferences.

## Key Features

- **Audio Analysis**: Beat detection, segment identification, and energy level analysis
- **Video Processing**: Scene detection, motion analysis, and content recognition
- **Automated Editing**: Intelligent cut points based on audio and video analysis
- **XML Export**: Generate industry-standard XML files for professional video editing software
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust editing style, transitions, and export formats

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Critical Issues (Blocking Release)

1. **TypeScript Configuration Issues**:
   - Missing module exports
   - Type incompatibilities
   - Incorrect import paths
   - Application fails to render due to these issues

2. **WebAssembly Loading**:
   - WebAssembly modules may not load properly due to TypeScript errors
   - Import issues in wasmLoader.ts

### Non-Critical Issues

1. **Performance Limitations**:
   - Large video files may cause performance issues in some browsers
   - Processing time increases significantly with 4K video content

2. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Limited support for Safari due to WebAssembly implementation differences
   - Mobile browsers have limited functionality

3. **UI/UX Refinements Needed**:
   - Some UI elements need polish
   - Error messages could be more user-friendly

## Browser Requirements

CineFlux-AutoXML requires a modern browser with WebAssembly support:

- **Chrome/Chromium**: Version 90 or later (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Version 86 or later
- **Edge**: Version 90 or later
- **Safari**: Version 14 or later (limited functionality)

Mobile browsers are supported but with limited functionality due to performance constraints.
