# CineFlux-AutoXML API Reference

## Overview

This document serves as the central reference for the CineFlux-AutoXML API, providing links to detailed documentation for each service and utility in the system. The CineFlux-AutoXML project is a comprehensive video editing and processing framework that leverages WebAssembly for high-performance operations.

## Core Services

### [AudioService](./api/AudioService.md)

The AudioService provides functionality for audio processing, analysis, and manipulation within the CineFlux-AutoXML system. It handles audio extraction, waveform generation, and integration with the editing pipeline.

Key features:
- Audio extraction from video files
- Waveform generation and visualization
- Audio analysis (volume levels, silence detection)
- Audio segment processing

### [EditService](./api/EditService.md)

The EditService manages and manipulates edit decision lists (EDLs) and performs video editing operations. It serves as the core component for timeline manipulation, clip management, and edit decision making.

Key features:
- Timeline creation and management
- Media import and organization
- Clip addition, removal, and manipulation
- EDL generation in various formats
- Effect application and management

### VideoService

The VideoService handles video processing, encoding, decoding, and transformation operations. It provides a high-level interface for video manipulation tasks.

Key features:
- Video transcoding and format conversion
- Frame extraction and manipulation
- Video effect processing
- Proxy generation for efficient editing

## Utilities

### [WASM Loader](./api/WasmLoader.md)

The WASM Loader utility provides functionality for loading, initializing, and managing WebAssembly modules. It handles module instantiation, memory management, and function exports.

Key features:
- WebAssembly module loading and initialization
- Memory allocation and management
- Function calling interface
- Data transfer between JavaScript and WebAssembly

### XML Generators

The XML Generators utility provides tools for generating and parsing XML documents used in various video editing formats and interchange standards.

Key features:
- EDL to XML conversion
- XML template generation
- Schema validation
- Format-specific adaptations (Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, etc.)

## Base Infrastructure

### BaseService

The BaseService class provides common functionality for all services in the system, including:

- Initialization and configuration
- Event handling and propagation
- Error management
- Resource allocation and cleanup
- Worker thread communication

## Integration Points

### Plugin Architecture

CineFlux-AutoXML supports a plugin architecture for extending functionality. See the [Plugin Architecture Documentation](./plugin-architecture.md) for details on creating and integrating plugins.

### External APIs

The system provides integration points with external APIs and services:

- Media asset management systems
- Cloud storage providers
- Render farms and processing services
- Collaboration platforms

## Error Handling

All APIs in the CineFlux-AutoXML system follow a consistent error handling pattern:

- Asynchronous operations return Promises that reject with specific error types
- Error objects contain detailed information about the cause and potential solutions
- Services emit error events that can be caught by listeners
- Logging infrastructure captures errors for debugging

## Version Compatibility

This API reference applies to CineFlux-AutoXML version 2.x. For documentation on previous versions, please refer to the archived documentation.
