### Outdated Packages
Several packages are still outdated but would require major version updates:
- React ecosystem:
  - `react` and `react-dom` (v18.3.1 → v19.1.0)
  - `@testing-library/react` (v14.3.1 → v16.3.0)
  - `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` (v18.x → v19.x)
- TypeScript ecosystem:
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` (v6.21.0 → v8.32.1)
- Testing tools:
  - `cypress` (v13.17.0 → v14.4.0)
- Linting and formatting:
  - `eslint` (v8.57.1 → v9.27.0)
  - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (v4.6.2 → v5.2.0)

  - `zustand` (v4.5.7 → v5.0.4)

### Build Status
- The build is currently failing with numerous TypeScript errors
- These errors are not related to the dependency updates but are pre-existing type issues in the codebase
- The errors include:
  - Type mismatches
  - Missing properties
  - Unused variables
  - Import errors
  - Re-export conflicts

## Recommendations

1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**: The project has numerous TypeScript errors that need to be addressed. These are not directly related to the dependency updates but will prevent successful builds.

2. **Incremental Major Version Updates**: For the remaining outdated packages, consider updating them one by one with thorough testing after each update:
   - Start with non-breaking or less impactful updates like utility libraries
   - Update React and its ecosystem as a coordinated update
   - Update TypeScript and related tools together

3. **WebAssembly Dependencies**: The WebAssembly dependencies (`@ffmpeg` and `opencv-js`) are currently up to date. Any future updates to these should be done with extra caution and testing.

4. **Testing Strategy**: Develop a comprehensive testing strategy before updating to React 19, as this will likely require significant changes to the codebase.

5. **Documentation**: Keep track of all dependency updates and their impacts in a changelog to help with future maintenance.
