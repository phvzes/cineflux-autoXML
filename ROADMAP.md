# CineFlux-AutoXML Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for CineFlux-AutoXML beyond the v1.0.0 release. It serves as a guide for contributors and users to understand the direction of the project and upcoming features.

## Version 1.1.0 (Next Release)

### Performance Optimizations

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| HIGH | WebAssembly Threading Support | Implement SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics to enable multi-threaded WebAssembly processing for audio and video analysis, potentially reducing processing time by 40-60% on compatible browsers. |
| HIGH | Incremental Processing Pipeline | Redesign processing pipeline to work incrementally, allowing users to start working with partial results while analysis continues in the background. |
| MEDIUM | Memory Usage Optimization | Implement more aggressive garbage collection and buffer reuse strategies to reduce peak memory usage during video processing by at least 30%. |
| MEDIUM | GPU Acceleration | Add WebGPU support (with WebGL fallback) for video processing tasks where applicable, focusing on scene detection and frame analysis. |
| LOW | Compression Optimization | Implement smarter compression strategies for temporary storage of processed media to reduce disk usage and improve cache efficiency. |

### Feature Enhancements

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| HIGH | Advanced Audio Analysis | Enhance audio analysis with harmonic/percussive separation, allowing for more nuanced beat detection and improved synchronization with different music genres. |
| HIGH | Custom Export Templates | Allow users to create and save custom XML export templates for different editing software and workflows. |
| MEDIUM | Batch Processing | Enable processing of multiple projects in sequence with a queue system and background processing. |
| MEDIUM | AI-Enhanced Scene Recognition | Implement machine learning models to identify scene content, mood, and composition to better match video segments with music characteristics. |
| MEDIUM | Transition Recommendations | Analyze audio and video characteristics to suggest appropriate transitions beyond simple cuts (dissolves, wipes, etc.) based on music energy and content. |
| LOW | Cloud Project Sync | Add optional cloud synchronization for project files to enable work across multiple devices (while maintaining the core privacy-focused, client-side processing model). |
| LOW | Collaborative Editing | Implement basic real-time collaboration features allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously. |

### Technical Debt Reduction

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| HIGH | Refactor State Management | Reorganize Zustand stores for better separation of concerns and improved performance, particularly for large projects. |
| HIGH | Module Bundling Strategy | Revise the module bundling strategy to further reduce initial load time and improve caching efficiency. |
| MEDIUM | Legacy Browser Support | Implement more robust fallback mechanisms for browsers with limited or no WebAssembly support. |
| MEDIUM | Code Documentation | Improve inline documentation and generate comprehensive API documentation for all core modules. |
| LOW | Dependency Audit | Conduct a thorough audit of dependencies to identify opportunities for replacement or removal to reduce bundle size. |

### Testing Improvements

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| HIGH | End-to-End Test Coverage | Expand Cypress test suite to cover all critical user workflows with at least 80% coverage of main features. |
| HIGH | Performance Regression Testing | Implement automated performance benchmarking as part of the CI pipeline to catch performance regressions early. |
| MEDIUM | Cross-Browser Compatibility Tests | Expand automated testing to cover all supported browsers and identify browser-specific issues earlier in development. |
| MEDIUM | Unit Test Coverage | Increase unit test coverage to at least 70% across all core modules, with emphasis on the Edit Decision Engine. |
| LOW | Stress Testing Framework | Develop a framework for stress testing the application with extremely large media files and complex projects. |

## Version 1.2.0

### Performance Optimizations

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| HIGH | Adaptive Quality Settings | Implement intelligent quality settings that adjust based on device capabilities and project complexity. |
| MEDIUM | WebCodecs API Integration | Migrate from FFmpeg.wasm to the native WebCodecs API where supported for improved performance and reduced memory usage. |
| MEDIUM | Distributed Processing | Research and implement a way to distribute heavy processing tasks across multiple browser tabs or windows to utilize system resources more effectively. |

### Feature Enhancements

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| HIGH | Advanced Timeline Editor | Develop a more sophisticated timeline editor with multi-track support and fine-grained control over edit decisions. |
| HIGH | Audio Effects and Adjustments | Add support for basic audio adjustments (EQ, normalization, fade in/out) directly within the application. |
| MEDIUM | Video Effects Library | Implement a library of video effects (color grading, overlays, etc.) that can be applied before export. |
| MEDIUM | Project Templates | Create and save project templates with predefined settings for quick start on new projects. |
| LOW | Social Media Export Presets | Add export presets optimized for various social media platforms with appropriate aspect ratios and format settings. |

### Technical Debt Reduction

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| HIGH | Architecture Refactoring | Refactor core architecture to improve modularity and make it easier to add new features without affecting existing functionality. |
| MEDIUM | Error Handling Improvements | Implement more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms throughout the application. |
| LOW | Accessibility Audit | Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit and implement improvements to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. |

### Testing Improvements

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| HIGH | Automated Visual Regression Testing | Implement visual regression testing to catch UI issues and rendering problems automatically. |
| MEDIUM | User Testing Program | Establish a formal user testing program to gather feedback on new features before release. |
| LOW | Localization Testing | Add testing infrastructure for localized versions of the application. |

## Version 2.0.0 (Long-term Vision)

### Major Features

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| HIGH | Direct Video Export | Implement direct video rendering and export capabilities without requiring external editing software. |
| HIGH | Advanced AI-Driven Editing | Develop sophisticated AI models for content-aware editing that understands both audio and visual context. |
| MEDIUM | Plugin System | Create an extensible plugin architecture allowing third-party developers to add new features and integrations. |
| MEDIUM | Mobile Support | Extend the application to work effectively on tablets and high-end mobile devices. |
| LOW | Professional Audio Tools | Add advanced audio tools including beat mapping, tempo adjustment, and audio replacement features. |

## Contribution Priorities

For contributors interested in helping advance the CineFlux-AutoXML project, the following areas would be most valuable to focus on:
