# User Acceptance Criteria Checklist

## Application Functionality Verification

### Core Rendering
- [ ] **Application renders without blank page** ❌ FAILED
  - Application currently fails to render properly due to TypeScript errors
  - Console shows critical errors preventing initialization
  - Root cause: TypeScript configuration issues including missing exports and type incompatibilities

### Error Handling
- [ ] **No critical console errors** ❌ FAILED
  - Multiple TypeScript errors appear in console
  - Import errors for core modules
  - Type incompatibility errors

### WebAssembly Integration
- [ ] **WebAssembly modules accessible** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering
  - WASM loading code contains TypeScript errors
  - Import issues in `wasmLoader.ts` need to be resolved

### UI Navigation
- [ ] **Core UI navigation works** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering
  - Navigation components contain TypeScript errors
  - Workflow stepper component has type incompatibility issues

### File Handling
- [ ] **File handling works** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering
  - File upload components contain TypeScript errors
  - Type issues in `InputStep.tsx` related to file handling

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Error handling is graceful** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering
  - Current errors are not handled gracefully
  - Application crashes instead of displaying user-friendly error messages

## Browser Compatibility

- [ ] **Chrome/Chromium** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering
  - WebAssembly support should be available in modern Chrome versions

- [ ] **Firefox** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering
  - WebAssembly support should be available in modern Firefox versions

- [ ] **Safari** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering
  - WebAssembly support may have limitations in Safari

## Performance Metrics

- [ ] **Initial load time < 5 seconds** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering

- [ ] **Video processing time acceptable** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering

- [ ] **Memory usage within limits** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering

## Accessibility

- [ ] **Keyboard navigation works** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering
  - Code contains keyboard navigation hooks that need TypeScript fixes

- [ ] **Screen reader compatibility** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering

- [ ] **Color contrast meets WCAG standards** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering

## Security

- [ ] **No exposed API keys or credentials** ✅ PASSED
  - No API keys or credentials found in the codebase

- [ ] **Secure file handling** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY
  - Unable to verify due to application not rendering

## Conclusion

The application fails to meet the minimum user acceptance criteria due to critical TypeScript configuration issues. These issues must be resolved before proceeding with user acceptance testing. The primary focus should be on fixing the TypeScript errors to enable basic application rendering, after which the remaining criteria can be properly evaluated.
