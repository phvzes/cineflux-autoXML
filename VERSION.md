## Versioning Scheme

CineFlux-AutoXML follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) for version numbering.

The version number format is: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

- **MAJOR** version increments indicate incompatible API changes or significant architectural changes
- **MINOR** version increments indicate new functionality added in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** version increments indicate backward-compatible bug fixes

### Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions may include additional labels:

- **alpha**: Early development versions with potentially unstable features
- **beta**: Feature-complete versions undergoing testing
- **rc**: Release candidates ready for final testing

Example: `1.0.0-beta.1`

- Adding significant new capabilities
- Making substantial improvements to existing features
- Adding new export formats or analysis algorithms

Example: Changing from v1.2.3 to v1.3.0

### When to Bump PATCH Version

Increment the PATCH version when:

- Fixing bugs without changing the API
- Making performance improvements
- Updating dependencies
- Fixing security vulnerabilities
- Making documentation changes
- Refactoring code without changing functionality

Example: Changing from v1.2.3 to v1.2.4

## Version Update Process

1. Determine the appropriate version increment based on the changes
2. Update the version number in:
   - `package.json`
   - `VERSION.md` (this file)
   - Any other version-specific files
3. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with details of the changes
4. Commit the changes with a message like "Bump version to x.y.z"
5. Tag the commit with the version: `git tag vx.y.z`
6. Push the changes and tags to the repository

## Version Display

The current version is displayed in:

- The application's About screen
- The console on application startup
- The exported XML files as metadata
- API responses (if applicable)

## Compatibility Information

### Backward Compatibility

- **v0.x.x**: Initial development phase, no backward compatibility guarantees
- **v1.x.x**: Stable API, backward compatibility within the same major version
- **v2.x.x+**: Future major versions with potential breaking changes

### Forward Compatibility

Projects created with an older version of CineFlux-AutoXML should be openable in newer versions within the same major version number. However, projects saved in newer versions may not be compatible with older versions of the software.
