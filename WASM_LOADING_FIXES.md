# WebAssembly Loading Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing WebAssembly Files**: The FFmpeg WebAssembly files were missing from the expected location in the public directory.
2. **OpenCV.js Loading Issues**: There was no proper initialization for OpenCV.js.
3. **CORS Headers Configuration**: While the application had the correct CORS headers set, the WebAssembly files themselves were missing.
4. **Initialization Issues**: The application was showing raw HTML content rather than rendering the React application.
5. **Custom WebAssembly Loader**: There was a custom `loadWasm` function in index.html that wasn't being used in the VideoService.ts file.
6. **Inconsistent Path References**: The VideoService was trying to load files from a path that didn't match the project structure.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Missing WebAssembly Files**:
   - Created the directory structure for FFmpeg WebAssembly files
   - Downloaded the required FFmpeg WebAssembly files to the correct location

2. **Created a WebAssembly Loader Utility**:
   - Implemented a consistent loading mechanism for WebAssembly modules
   - Added proper error handling for WebAssembly loading failures
   - Created environment-aware path resolution for WebAssembly files

3. **Updated VideoService Implementation**:
   - Improved the FFmpeg loading mechanism
   - Added proper OpenCV.js initialization
   - Implemented concurrent loading of both WebAssembly modules
   - Added proper error handling and resource cleanup

4. **Updated HTML Configuration**:
   - Ensured CORS headers are correctly set
   - Added preloading for WebAssembly files to improve performance

5. **Created a Test Page**:
   - Implemented a simple test page to verify WebAssembly loading
   - Added tests for browser WebAssembly support, FFmpeg loading, OpenCV loading, and CORS policy

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the test page in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/wasm-test.html
   ```

3. Click the "Test FFmpeg Loading" and "Test OpenCV Loading" buttons to verify that the WebAssembly modules load correctly.

## Notes

- The WebAssembly files are now loaded from the `/assets/ffmpeg-core/` directory in the public folder.
- OpenCV.js is loaded from a CDN in the test page, but in the actual application, it's loaded from the `@techstark/opencv-js` package.
- The CORS headers are set in both the HTML file and the Vite configuration to ensure proper WebAssembly loading.
- The WebAssembly loader utility provides a consistent loading mechanism for all WebAssembly modules in the application.
