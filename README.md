## Description

CineFlux-AutoXML is a powerful browser-based application that automatically creates professional music videos by intelligently synchronizing video clips with music tracks. Using advanced audio analysis and visual content recognition, it identifies musical beats, energy levels, and video scene changes to create perfectly timed edits. The system exports industry-standard XML files compatible with professional editing software like Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve.

### Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests with Cypress
- `npm run lint` - Run linting
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run clean` - Remove build artifacts

### Git Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

3. Push your branch and create a pull request.

4. Ensure CI checks pass before merging.

## Build Process

### Standard Build

The build process uses Vite for fast and optimized builds:

```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Development build
npm run build:dev

# Build with bundle analysis
npm run build:analyze
```

### Build Optimization

The build process includes several optimizations:

- **Code Splitting**: Automatically splits code into chunks for better loading performance
- **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused code
- **Minification**: Reduces file sizes
- **Compression**: Applies gzip/brotli compression
- **WebAssembly Optimization**: Optimizes loading of WebAssembly modules

For detailed information on build optimizations, see [Build Optimization Guide](docs/BUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md).

### TypeScript Configuration

The project uses TypeScript for type safety. The build process includes:

- Type checking before build
- Separate tsconfig files for different build targets
- Optimized TypeScript compilation

## Deployment Options

CineFlux-AutoXML supports multiple deployment options:

### Docker Deployment

The recommended deployment method is using Docker:

```bash
# Build and run the production container
docker-compose up -d app-prod
```

For detailed Docker deployment instructions, see the [Docker Usage Guide](docs/DOCKER.md).

### Static Hosting

The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `dist` directory to your hosting service.

### CI/CD Integration

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration:

- Automated testing
- Linting and formatting checks
- Build verification

To set up continuous deployment:

1. Configure your deployment platform (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
2. Connect your repository
3. Set the build command to `npm run build`
4. Set the publish directory to `dist`

## Performance Optimization

### Client-side Processing Architecture

CineFlux-AutoXML employs a client-side processing architecture that prioritizes:

- **User Privacy**: All processing happens locally
- **Performance**: Uses WebAssembly for near-native performance
- **Accessibility**: Works offline after initial load

### Optimization Techniques

- **WebAssembly Modules**: Uses compiled C/C++ code for performance-critical operations
- **Web Workers**: Offloads heavy processing to background threads
- **Memory Management**: Implements efficient memory usage patterns
- **Caching**: Caches processed data to avoid redundant calculations
- **Lazy Loading**: Loads components and resources only when needed

### Performance Monitoring

The application includes performance monitoring tools:

- Bundle size analysis
- Runtime performance metrics
- Memory usage tracking
