## Project Overview

CineFlux-AutoXML is a powerful browser-based application that automatically creates professional music videos by intelligently synchronizing video clips with music tracks. Using advanced audio analysis and visual content recognition, it identifies musical beats, energy levels, and video scene changes to create perfectly timed edits. The system exports industry-standard XML files compatible with professional editing software like Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve.

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Audio Analysis**: Automatically detects beats, identifies segments, and creates energy profiles from music tracks to drive video editing decisions.
- **Advanced Video Analysis**: Performs scene detection, content analysis, and motion tracking to identify optimal cut points and transitions.
- **Beat-Synchronized Editing**: Precisely matches video cuts and transitions with musical beats and energy changes for professional-quality results.
- **Real-time Preview**: Visualizes edits in the browser before export, allowing for adjustments and fine-tuning.
- **Multi-format Export**: Generates industry-standard XML files (FCPXML, Adobe Premiere Pro XML, DaVinci Resolve XML) for seamless integration with professional editing software.
- **Browser-based Processing**: Performs all operations client-side using WebAssembly technologies, ensuring privacy and eliminating the need for server uploads.

### Use Cases and Target Audience

- **Content Creators**: YouTubers, social media influencers, and digital marketers looking to create engaging music-driven content quickly.
- **Music Video Producers**: Professional and amateur music video creators seeking to streamline their workflow.
- **Editors**: Video editors looking for a tool to automate the initial synchronization of music and video.
- **Musicians**: Artists wanting to create promotional videos for their music without extensive editing knowledge.
- **Event Videographers**: Wedding and event videographers creating highlight reels synchronized to music.
- **Educational Institutions**: Schools and universities teaching video production with limited resources.

## Architecture

CineFlux-AutoXML uses a client-side processing architecture that leverages WebAssembly for high-performance audio and video processing directly in the browser.

### Architecture Explanation

CineFlux-AutoXML is built on a modular architecture that processes everything client-side:

1. **Input Module**: Handles file uploads and initial processing of audio and video files.
2. **Audio Analysis Module**: Analyzes music tracks to detect beats, energy levels, and segments.
3. **Video Analysis Module**: Processes video clips to detect scenes, content, and motion.
4. **Edit Decision Engine**: Combines audio and video analysis to generate synchronized edit decisions.
5. **Preview Generator**: Creates a real-time preview of the edited video.
6. **Export Module**: Generates industry-standard XML files for professional editing software.

All processing occurs in the browser using WebAssembly modules (FFmpeg.wasm, OpenCV.js, Essentia.js) and Web APIs (Web Audio API, Canvas API, Web Workers). This architecture ensures user privacy as no media files are uploaded to servers, and provides high performance through optimized compiled code.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or pnpm package manager
- Modern browser with WebAssembly support (Chrome 74+, Firefox 78+, Safari 14.1+, Edge 79+)
- Git

### Installation

#### Standard Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cineflux-autoxml.git
   cd cineflux-autoxml
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install
   
   # Using pnpm (recommended for faster installation)
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run dev
   
   # Using pnpm
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

#### Docker Installation

For Docker-based installation:

1. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up app-dev
   ```

2. Or start the production environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up app-prod
   ```

### Basic Usage

1. **Upload Media**: Upload your music track and video clips.
2. **Analysis**: Let the application analyze your media files.
3. **Edit**: Review and adjust the automatically generated edit decisions.
4. **Preview**: Watch a real-time preview of your edited video.
5. **Export**: Generate an XML file for your preferred editing software.
