## Description

CineFlux-AutoXML is a powerful browser-based application that automatically creates professional music videos by intelligently synchronizing video clips with music tracks. Using advanced audio analysis and visual content recognition, it identifies musical beats, energy levels, and video scene changes to create perfectly timed edits. The system exports industry-standard XML files compatible with professional editing software like Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Audio Analysis**: Automatically detects beats, identifies segments, and creates energy profiles from music tracks to drive video editing decisions.

- **Advanced Video Analysis**: Performs scene detection, content analysis, and motion tracking to identify optimal cut points and transitions.

- **Beat-Synchronized Editing**: Precisely matches video cuts and transitions with musical beats and energy changes for professional-quality results.

- **Real-time Preview**: Visualizes edits in the browser before export, allowing for adjustments and fine-tuning.

- **Multi-format Export**: Generates industry-standard XML files (FCPXML, Adobe Premiere Pro XML, DaVinci Resolve XML) for seamless integration with professional editing software.

- **Browser-based Processing**: Performs all operations client-side using WebAssembly technologies, ensuring privacy and eliminating the need for server uploads.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or pnpm package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cineflux-autoxml.git
   cd cineflux-autoxml
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install
   
   # Using pnpm (recommended for faster installation)
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run dev
   
   # Using pnpm
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Notes on FFmpeg.wasm

CineFlux-AutoXML uses FFmpeg.wasm for video processing, which requires:

- A modern browser with WebAssembly support
- Sufficient memory allocation (at least 2GB recommended)
- For local development, you may need to adjust CORS settings in your browser

## Usage Guide

### Creating a New Project

1. **Launch the application** in your browser
2. **Create a new project** by clicking the "New Project" button
3. **Enter project details**:
   - Project name
   - Output format (FCPXML, Adobe Premiere Pro XML, DaVinci Resolve XML)
   - Project settings (resolution, frame rate)

   *Screenshot would show the project creation form with fields for name, format selection dropdown, and project settings.*

### Adding Media

1. **Import audio track**:
   - Click "Add Audio" button
   - Select a music file from your local storage
   - The system will automatically analyze the audio for beats and energy levels

   *Screenshot would show the audio import interface with waveform visualization and beat markers.*

2. **Import video clips**:
   - Click "Add Videos" button
   - Select multiple video files or drag and drop them into the designated area
   - The system will automatically analyze each clip for scene changes and content

   *Screenshot would show the video import interface with thumbnail previews of imported clips.*

### Generating and Previewing Edits

1. **Configure edit parameters**:
   - Adjust sensitivity for beat detection
   - Set transition types and durations
   - Configure content matching preferences

   *Screenshot would show the edit configuration panel with sliders and option selectors.*

2. **Generate edit preview**:
   - Click "Generate Preview" button
   - The system will process the media and create a synchronized edit
   - Preview the result in the built-in player

   *Screenshot would show the preview player with timeline and playback controls.*

3. **Refine the edit**:
   - Make adjustments to parameters as needed
   - Regenerate preview until satisfied

### Exporting the Project

1. **Export XML**:
   - Click "Export" button
   - Select destination folder
   - Choose export format (if not already specified)
   - The system will generate the XML file

   *Screenshot would show the export dialog with format options and progress indicator.*

2. **Import into editing software**:
   - Open your preferred editing software (Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve)
   - Import the generated XML file
   - All edits, cuts, and transitions will be preserved

## Architecture Overview

CineFlux-AutoXML follows a modular architecture designed for extensibility and maintainability. The system is built around six primary modules and five core services that work together to provide a seamless editing experience.
