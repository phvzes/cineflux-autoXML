## Patterns of Errors That Couldn't Be Fixed Automatically
Based on the analysis of remaining errors, the following patterns were identified:

1. **Type Compatibility Issues**: Many errors relate to incompatible types being assigned or returned.
2. **Interface Implementation Errors**: Objects not properly implementing their interfaces.
3. **Complex Type Inference**: Cases where TypeScript cannot infer types in complex scenarios.
4. **External Library Type Definitions**: Issues with type definitions from external libraries.
5. **Conditional Types**: Errors in conditional type expressions that are too complex for automated fixing.

## Recommendations
1. Manually address the remaining errors, focusing first on files with the highest error counts.
2. Consider adding more comprehensive type definitions for external libraries.
3. Implement stricter TypeScript configuration gradually to prevent new errors.
4. Add unit tests to ensure type safety during future development.
