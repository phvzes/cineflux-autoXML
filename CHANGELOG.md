## How to Write Good Changelog Entries

### Do
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be specific about what changed and why
- Group changes by type (Added, Changed, etc.)
- Link to issues or pull requests when relevant
- Mention breaking changes prominently
- Include migration instructions for major changes

### Don't
- Include commit messages verbatim
- Use technical jargon without explanation
- Omit important changes
- Include trivial changes (like typo fixes)

## Release Process

1. Update the version in `package.json` and `VERSION.md`
2. Update the changelog with all notable changes
3. Create a new section for the release with the format `[x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
4. Move all entries from "Unreleased" to the new section
5. Commit the changes with the message "Release x.y.z"
6. Tag the commit with the version number: `git tag v1.2.3`
7. Push the changes and tags: `git push && git push --tags`
8. Create a new release on GitHub with the changelog entries
